# Compiler Design and Construction
## Introduction
Programs written in any programming language needs to be translated to a machine readable form before it can be executed by the computer. This translation is done by a special program called compiler.  

In other words, compiler is a program that can read a program in one language or the source language and translate it into an equivalent program in another language or the target language.

If the target program is an executable machine-language program, it can then be called by users to process output & provide results

#### Interpreter:
    	It is another popular language processor that directly executes the operations specified in source program as inputs supplied by users. No target program is produced.
- It is slower at mapping inputs and outputs.
- It gives better error diagnostics.
